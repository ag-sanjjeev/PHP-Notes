- Access and manipulate databases,
- Process user input from forms and requests,
- Generate dynamic content based on different conditions and logics,
- Create interactive features like user authentication and handling user data.

PHP code can be embedded within HTML files using special tags. When a web server receives a request for the web page, That server executes the PHP code first, then it generating HTML content that is then sent back to the user's browser.
